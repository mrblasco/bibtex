  abstract	= {While there is a large literature on attitudes toward
		  immigrants, scholars have not systematically examined the
		  determinants of attitudes toward refugees. Often, refugees
		  are simply treated as a subset of immigrants, under the
		  assumption that attitudes toward both sets of foreigners
		  are similar. In this article, we examine whether there are
		  distinctions between attitudes toward refugees and
		  immigrants, as well as variation in their determinants. We
		  address these questions using individual-level data from 16
		  countries in the 2002 and 2014 waves of the European Social
		  Survey. We demonstrate that these two groups of foreigners
		  are, indeed, viewed as distinct and that differences emerge
		  because attitudes toward refugees are more often related to
		  macro-level factors while immigrants are more frequently
		  associated with micro-level economic concerns. By
		  distinguishing between refugees and immigrants, this
		  article addresses an important gap in the academic
		  literature on attitudes toward foreigners in Europe.},

  abstract	= {Studies on the effects of information provision on
		  residential energy use conclude that such information can
		  promote households' energy-saving investments and
		  conservation behavior. However, most of these studies are
		  conducted in the U.S. or in other OECD countries, where
		  households, on average, are richer and consume more
		  electricity. This study evaluates the effect of descriptive
		  information provision on residential electricity
		  consumption in a less wealthy OECD country - Lithuania. By
		  using a randomized experiment, we find that the
		  availability of descriptive hourly electricity information
		  provided on web portals reduces electricity consumption by
		  about 8.6\%. This effect is equivalent to an annual energy
		  saving of 241 kWh per household. The effect is more
		  pronounced for households with high energy consumption,
		  living in rural areas and detached houses.},

		  persons receiving temporary protection. It discusses the
		  role of established national communities and migration
		  networks in migrants? settlement decisions and it provides
		  an overview of the distribution of Ukrainian citizens

  abstract	= {Perception of peer rank, or how we perform relative to our
		  peers, can be a powerful motivator. While research exists
		  on the effect of social information on decision making,
		  there is less work on how ranked comparisons with our peers
		  influence our behavior. This paper outlines a field
		  experiment conducted with 3896 households in Castro Valley,
		  California, which uses household mailers with various forms
		  of social information and peer rank messaging to motivate
		  water conservation. The experiment tests the effect of a
		  visible peer rank on water use, and how the competitive
		  framing of rank information influences behavioral response.
		  The results show that households with relatively low or
		  high water use in the pre-treatment period responded
		  differently to how rank information was framed. I find that
		  a neutrally-framed peer rank caused a small ``boomerang
		  effect{''} (i.e., an increase in average water use) for low
		  water use households, but this effect was eliminated by
		  competitive framing. At the same time, a
		  competitively-framed peer rank demotivated high water use
		  households, increasing their average water use over the
		  full period of the experiment. This result is supported by
		  evidence that the competitive frame on rank information
		  increased water use for households who ranked ``last{''} in
		  the peer group - a detrimental ``last place effect{''} from
		  competitively-framed rankings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract	= {The provision of feedback about individual electricity
		  consumption is a widely used approach to promote
		  pro-environmental behavior. This form of feedback typically
		  invokes social comparisons by informing households about
		  their aggregate electricity consumption relative to others.
		  While previous research has shown that aggregate
		  consumption feedback translates into significant energy
		  savings, the potential for further reductions may remain
		  untapped because households lack knowledge about their
		  appliance energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we
		  present evidence from a field experiment, where we provide
		  residents with feedback about their electricity
		  consumption, specific to a high-energy use appliance (i.e.
		  air-conditioner). We provide the relevant social norm
		  information by varying the reference group of each
		  resident. We find that our appliance-specific feedback is a
		  powerful tool to curb electricity consumption. Residents
		  significantly reduce their average air-conditioning usage
		  by 17\% in our treatment groups. Notwithstanding, our
		  effects are not driven by comparative feedback with respect
		  to different reference groups. We interpret this as
		  encouraging evidence to promote the use of
		  appliance-specific feedback to realize energy savings.},

  abstract	= {The UK needs to accelerate action to achieve its 80 per
		  cent carbon reduction target by 2050 as it is otherwise in
		  danger of lagging behind. A much discussed question in this
		  context is whether voluntary behaviour change initiatives
		  can make a significant contribution to reaching this
		  target. While providing individuals with general
		  information on climate change or low carbon action is
		  increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies argue that
		  personalised information has greater potential to encourage
		  behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this
		  claim through a longitudinal field experiment which tested
		  the effectiveness of a carbon calculator interview. It
		  finds that the intervention significantly raised awareness
		  of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon
		  footprint. However, this increased awareness did not
		  translate into measurable behaviour changes in relation to
		  home energy and travel. Qualitative analysis shows that
		  participants refer to infrastructural, social and
		  psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more
		  ambitious government and corporate action is required to
		  speed up carbon reduction.},

@Article{	  caballero2021tackling,
  abstract	= {Behavioral Economics has in recent years played a key role
		  in informing the design of non-price interventions aimed at
		  promoting energy conservation behaviors in residential
		  housing. Some of the most influential contributions of the
		  discipline in an applied setting have centered around the
		  development of norm-based interventions. The success that
		  these interventions have had in specific contexts presents
		  an opportunity to exploit them as tools for tackling a
		  prevalent type of poverty at the EU level: energy poverty.
		  Recent contributions to the literature highlight the role
		  of inefficient energy behavior as a significant driver of
		  this particular type of poverty, which is characterized by
		  an inability to afford the basic energy services necessary
		  to guarantee a decent standard of living. Therefore, the
		  effectiveness of norm-based interventions in vulnerable
		  populations merits further investigation to determine
		  whether this approach can suitably address the behavioral
		  components of energy poverty by promoting efficient energy
		  consumption and conservation efforts. This study reports on
		  a pilot conducted in an exemplary social housing context
		  (located in Bolzano, Italy) with the aim to assess the
		  effectiveness of social comparison interventions in energy
		  vulnerable groups. Our investigated cohort covers an
		  initial small sample of apartments with a large
		  representatives of elderly individuals and other
		  energy-vulnerable groups. Using a design that combines
		  appeals to injunctive and descriptive norms embedded within
		  In-Home Devices (IHD) in recently retrofitted homes, our
		  objective is to set a basis for the assessment of
		  effectiveness of these types of interventions in social
		  housing populations. Our study seeks to provide useful
		  methodological insights to policy makers on how to
		  effectively design behaviorally informed interventions
		  aimed at tackling energy poverty. Despite the current data
		  limitations, our results do seem to suggest that uniformly
		  applied norm-based interventions may have potentially
		  backfiring effects in small-scale implementations.
		  Therefore, they suggest that attention needs to be paid to
		  household composition and pre-existing levels of
		  consumption, when designing behavior-change interventions
		  in these groups.},

  abstract	= {Bottom-up solutions targeting individual energy
		  conservation behaviors can play an important role in
		  mitigating climate change and other environmental problems.
		  Information interventions using social comparisons have
		  proven generally effective at improving conservation
		  behaviors, yet are largely suboptimal and sometimes fail
		  when not adequately designed for their specific context.
		  Environmental managers and policy makers need guidance on
		  behavioral intervention design to maximize effectiveness.
		  This article reports the results of a randomized control
		  trial field experiment that used social comparisons to
		  influence individual electricity conservation behaviors in
		  a unique experimental setting with homogeneous residential
		  units and no economic incentive for subjects to conserve.
		  Two treatment groups receiving information feedback with
		  different social comparison reference points exhibited an
		  average treatment effect of 6 \% relative to a control
		  group that did not receive feedback. Moreover, treated
		  subjects whose baseline behavior was more proximate to
		  their relevant comparison group norm exhibited stronger
		  response to the treatment (greater than 10 \%) than treated
		  subjects whose baseline behavior was more distant from the
		  relevant norm. These results demonstrate that individuals
		  may be more responsive to social norms when provided with a
		  relevant norm that is more proximate to their baseline
		  behavior. Our findings have important practical
		  implications for optimal design and implementation of
		  behavioral interventions to improve environmental
		  management and achieve energy policy goals.},

		  of nudges on households' pro-environmental behaviors.
		  Interestingly, ``private nudges{''} can be imagined for
		  companies. Yet, studies focusing on nudging employees'
		  energy use are rare. The objective of our paper is to
		  explore this issue with the help of a field experiment
		  conducted at 47 French companies' sites. Using a
		  difference-in-difference methodology, the effects of three
		  nudges on employees' energy conservation are tested. The
		  first nudge, ``moral appeal{''}, stresses the responsible
		  use of energy. The second one, ``social comparison{''},
		  informs employees on the energy consumption of other firms
		  participating in the experiment. Finally, the third nudge,
		  ``stickers{''}, alerts employees about good energy
		  conservation practices. Our results stress the
		  complementarity of these nudges. When implemented alone,
		  the three nudges have no significant effects on energy
		  consumption. However, when the moral appeal and social
		  comparison nudges are combined with the stickers nudge,
		  they become effective.},

  abstract	= {This study uses high-frequency appliance-level electricity
		  consumption data for 124 apartments over 24 months to
		  provide a better understanding of appliance-level
		  electricity consumption behavior. We conduct our analysis
		  in a standardized set of apartments with similar
		  appliances, which allows us to identify behavioral
		  differences in electricity use. The Results show that
		  households' estimations of appliance-level consumption are
		  inaccurate and that they overestimate lighting use by 75\%
		  and underestimate plug-load use by 29\%. We find that
		  similar households using the same major appliances exhibit
		  substantial variation in appliance-level electricity
		  consumption. For example, households in the 75th percentile
		  of HVAC usage use over four times as much electricity as a
		  user in the 25th percentile. Additionally, we show that
		  behavior accounts for 25-58\% of this variation. Lastly, we
		  find that replacing the existing refrigerator with a more
		  energy-efficient model leads to overall energy savings of
		  approximately 11\%. This is equivalent to results from
		  behavioral interventions targeting all appliances but might
		  not be as cost effective. Our findings have important
		  implications for behavior-based energy conservation

		  strategies on energy conservation in developing countries.
		  In this study, we conduct a field experiment in an
		  apartment complex in India to test how information about
		  electricity usage impacts the electricity consumption of
		  urban middle class households. Our results, based on
		  fifteen-minute electricity readings over an academic year,
		  show that non-monetary messages that framed electricity
		  consumption in terms of environmental and health impacts
		  were more effective than messages emphasizing the monetary
		  savings of reducing electricity consumption. Households in
		  the environmental/health group accessed the online
		  energy-monitoring dashboard more frequently and reduced
		  their electricity usage by 18.4\% relative to the control
		  group. Households in the monetary group did not
		  significantly alter their usage. These results about
		  revealed preferences are contrasted with stated preferences
		  disclosed in a survey of urban Indians who describe money,
		  not health, as the main motivation for energy conservation.
		  Our findings have important implications for the
		  development non-monetary strategies for energy conservation

  abstract	= {Should policy-makers combine price incentives with
		  behavioural nudges to encourage sustainable energy
		  behaviour? Available evidence from various behavioural
		  sciences is scarce and inconclusive about synergy of the
		  two instruments. This is partly due to methodological
		  limitations. We offer a framework to overcome such
		  limitations in future research and to guide policy-making.
		  It includes four cases: no synergy, positive synergy, weak
		  negative synergy, and strong negative synergy or backfire.
		  The adoption of a policy mix is recommended in the first
		  two cases, and may be pursued in the third case. To clarify
		  the underlying mechanisms of the synergy, a distinction is
		  made between crowding (in/out) of intrinsic motivations by
		  incentives and crowding (in/out) of extrinsic motivations
		  by nudges. This distinction turns out to be especially
		  relevant in the case of weakly negative synergy, as here
		  behavioural and temporal spillover effects require
		  consideration from the policy-maker as well. We end with
		  broader reflections regarding other policy criteria for the
		  design of an adequate energy policy mix.},

  abstract	= {Policymakers often rely on non-pecuniary,
		  information-based programs to achieve social objectives.
		  Using data from a water conservation information campaign
		  implemented as a randomized controlled trial, we estimate
		  heterogeneous household responses. Understanding such
		  heterogeneity is important for improving the
		  cost-effectiveness of non-pecuniary programs, extending
		  them to other populations and probing the mechanisms
		  through which the treatment effects arise. We find little
		  evidence of heterogeneous responses to purely technical
		  information or to traditional conservation messages that
		  combine technical information and moral suasion. In
		  contrast, norm-based messages that combine technical
		  information, moral suasion and social comparisons exhibit
		  strong heterogeneity: households that are wealthier,
		  owner-occupied and use more water are more responsive.
		  These subgroups tend to be least responsive to pecuniary
		  incentives. We find no evidence that any subgroup increases
		  their water use in response to the messages. By targeting
		  the messages to subgroups known to be most responsive,
		  program costs could be reduced by over 50\% with only a
		  20\% reduction in the treatment effect. Combining theory
		  and data, we also shed light on the mechanisms through
		  which the treatment effects arise, which has implications
		  for program design and future research on the program's
		  welfare effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

		  a low-cost carefully-crafted notecard can increase the
		  probability of a household to follow through with an
		  already scheduled audit by 1.1 percentage points on a given
		  day. The effect is very similar across individuals with
		  different political views, but households in rural areas
		  display a substantially greater effect than those in urban
		  areas. Our findings have important managerial and policy
		  implications, as they suggest a cost-effective nudge for
		  increasing energy audit uptake and voluntary energy

  abstract	= {The present paper contributes to the literature on the
		  formation of attitudes and public views toward out-group
		  populations by focusing on the relations between actual
		  versus perceived and misperceived size of immigrant
		  population (as indicators of competitive threat) and
		  attitudes toward immigration. The analysis is conducted in
		  the context of 17 European societies. The data for the
		  analysis were obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey
		  (ESS). The main findings lead to the conclusion that
		  misperceptions of the size of immigrant population play a
		  more important role than factual reality in shaping public
		  views and attitudes toward immigration. Although perceived
		  size is not totally detached from actual size, the
		  discrepancy between actual and perceived size is found to
		  be a more powerful predictor of opposition to immigration
		  than actual size. The more inflated is the misperception
		  the more pronounced is opposition to immigration. The
		  impact of misperceptions, when measured as a discrepancy or
		  a ratio, on anti-immigrant attitudes is more pronounced in
		  countries with, proportionally, a large foreign-born
		  population. The meaning of the findings and the relevance
		  of misperceptions and cognitive maps in shaping public
		  views are discussed. {\copyright} 2019, {\copyright} 2019

  abstract	= {Strategies aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward
		  immigrants are at the core of integration policies. A large
		  literature shows that misperceptions about the size and
		  characteristics of immigrants are common. A few studies
		  implemented interventions to correct innumeracy regarding
		  the size of the immigrant population, but they did not
		  detect any effects on attitudes. We study whether providing
		  information not only about the size but also about the
		  characteristics of the immigrant population can have
		  stronger effects. We conduct two online experiments with
		  samples from the United States, providing one-half of the
		  participants with five statistics about immigration. This
		  information bundle improves people's attitudes toward
		  current legal immigrants. Most effects are driven by
		  Republicans and other groups with more negative initial
		  attitudes toward immigrants. In our second experiment, we
		  show that treatment effects persist one month later.
		  Finally, we analyze a large cross-country survey experiment
		  to provide external validity to the finding that
		  information about the size of the foreign-born population
		  is not enough to change policy views. We conclude that
		  people with negative views on immigration before the
		  intervention can become more supportive of immigration if
		  their misperceptions about the characteristics of the
		  foreign-born population are corrected. {\copyright} 2020,

  abstract	= {Our sociological knowledge of crime is fragmented and
		  ineffective in challenging and correcting mistaken public
		  perceptions, for example, linking immigration and crime.
		  These misperceptions are perpetuated by government reports
		  of growing numbers of Hispanic immigrants in U.S. prisons.
		  However, Hispanic immigrants are disproportionately young
		  males who regardless of citizenship are at greater risk of
		  criminal involvement. They are also more vulnerable to
		  restrictive treatment in the criminal justice system,
		  especially at the pre-trial stage. When these differences
		  are integrated into calculations using equations that begin
		  with observed numbers of immigrants and citizens in state
		  prisons, it is estimated that the involvement of Hispanic
		  immigrants in crime is less than that of citizens. These
		  results cast doubt on the hypothesis that immigration
		  causes crime and make more transparent the immigration and
		  criminal justice policies that inflate the rate of Hispanic
		  incarceration. This transparency helps to resolve a paradox
		  in the picture of Mexican immigration to the United States,
		  since by most measures of well-being, Mexican immigrants
		  are found to do as well and sometimes better than
		  citizens.},

		  general insights from the literature. First, the ``law of
		  demand{''} is typically satisfied in experimental settings,
		  but responsiveness to energy price changes can vary
		  dramatically in different contexts. Second, information
		  provision can help promote reductions in energy use, but it
		  does not always work. Third, the use of social norms can
		  change energy use. Finally, the economic welfare impacts of
		  behavioral interventions aimed at promoting either energy
		  conservation or energy efficiency are not well understood,
		  but initial research suggests that some people want nudges
		  and some do not. The essay also identifies a number of
		  areas for future research.},

		  population sizes to be much larger than they are in
		  reality. To date, little is understood about the extent or
		  causes of this phenomenon, known as innumeracy, which may
		  have consequences for inter-group relations. However,
		  before the literature can assess these consequences, a
		  better understanding of the development of these
		  misperceptions is needed. The extant literature focuses
		  only on the United States and lacks a clear understanding
		  of how innumeracy arises. Drawing from the 2002 European
		  Social Survey (ESS), this study attempts to make sense of
		  this phenomenon by proposing and testing a framework that
		  views innumeracy among majority group members as developing
		  in two ways: As cognitive mistakes and emotional responses.
		  I establish the existence and extent of the phenomenon
		  across 21 European nations, test new key predictors such as
		  media exposure and socio-economic status, and find
		  independent associations with cognitive and emotional
		  factors using multi-level regression analyses. {\copyright}

		  provide evidence that loss-averse people are less likely to

  abstract	= {Previous research shows that people commonly exaggerate
		  the size of minority populations. Theories of intergroup
		  threat predict that the larger people perceive minority
		  groups to be, the less favorably they feel toward them. We
		  investigate whether correcting Americans' misperceptions
		  about one such population---immigrants---affects related
		  attitudes. We confirm that non-Hispanic Americans
		  overestimate the percentage of the population that is
		  foreign-born or in the United States without authorization.
		  However, in seven separate survey experiments over 11
		  years, we find that providing accurate information does
		  little to affect attitudes toward immigration, even though
		  it does reduce the perceived size of the foreign-born
		  population. This is true even when people's misperceptions
		  are explicitly corrected. These results call into question
		  a potential cognitive mechanism that could underpin
		  intergroup threat theory. Misperceptions about the size of
		  minority groups may be a consequence, rather than a cause,
		  of attitudes toward those groups. {\copyright} 2018 by the

  abstract	= {Appeals to act pro-socially are becoming an increasingly
		  popular way for utilities and authorities to encourage
		  environmental-friendly behavior because of lower financial
		  costs than if price incentives were used. However, recent
		  research suggests that these measures might be emotionally
		  taxing for utility consumers. In this article, we present
		  the results from a randomized field experiment conducted on
		  a sample of 1967 customers serviced by a Danish electricity
		  company. Our results support the suggestion that socially
		  motivated appeals are significantly more emotionally taxing
		  than monetary incentives. We find that this difference
		  disappears when the pro-social appeal is supplemented with
		  a monetary incentive. Finally, we suggest a strategy for
		  reducing emotional `costs' of pro-social appeals without
		  increasing financial costs or reducing the effectiveness of
		  the appeal.},

  abstract	= {In a large-scale randomized field experiment in Chisinau,
		  Moldova, with over 120,0 0 0 households, we tested the
		  influence of a simple, one-time letter presenting
		  electricity usage social comparison feedback. The letter
		  was framed in either kilowatt-hour units or monetary
		  values. We find that both letter versions significantly
		  reduce recipient households' electricity consumption by
		  1.7-2.1 percent in the following month, and the effect
		  persists for at least three months. The effect's magnitude
		  and duration resemble those seen in similar trials in the
		  U.S., even though Moldova's average household electricity
		  consumption level is much lower. As the first large-scale
		  field experiment testing social comparison energy reports
		  in a post-Soviet environment, this study provides empirical
		  evidence that non-price nudges can be an inexpensive yet
		  useful energy conservation policy tool even in non-Western
		  and less industrialized settings. We explore the
		  relationship between Moldova's socioecological contexts and
		  environmental attitudes as a former Soviet Union country
		  and the relatively strong social norm effect that we
		  observed. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract	= {We investigate the complementarity among different
		  treatments which involved ``boosts{''} (provision of
		  information) and ``goals{''} (ambitious or modest goals) by
		  means of a field experiment conducted in the Principality
		  of Monaco between December 2018 and May 2019. We collected
		  data from 77 households in four groups: ambitious
		  electricity reduction goal combined with information
		  (Treatment 1), modest electricity reduction goal combined
		  with information (Treatment 2), only information (Treatment
		  3), and a control group (CG). Treatments 1 and 2 increased
		  the chances of reduced electricity consumption. We show
		  that a modest, more realistic electricity saving goal when
		  combined with a ``boost{''} generates better electricity
		  conservation performance (T2). We explore the link between
		  behavioral strategies and the household's concern for the
		  environment in the context of the new ecological paradigm
		  (NEP). Our results show that treatments T1 and T2 are
		  efficient for reducing electricity consumption only in
		  households with high levels of environmental concern; those
		  whose level of concern about the environment is low will
		  not respond to any of the behavioral interventions. We
		  provide some recommendations for the implementation of
		  behavioral tools and ``boosts{''}.},

@Article{	  liebe2018welcome,
  abstract	= {Europe recently experienced a large influx of refugees,
		  spurring much public debate about the admission and
		  integration of refugees and migrants into society. Previous
		  research based on cross-sectional data found that European
		  citizens generally favour asylum seek- ers with high
		  employability, severe vulnerabilities, and Christians over
		  Muslims. These pref- erences and attitudes were found to be
		  homogeneous across countries and socio- demographic groups.
		  Here, we do not study the general acceptance of asylum
		  seekers, but the acceptance of refugee and migrant homes in
		  citizens' vicinity and how it changes over time. Based on a
		  repeated stated choice experiment on preferences for
		  refugee and migrant homes, we show that the initially
		  promoted ``welcome culture'' towards refugees in Germany
		  was not reflected in the views of a majority of a sample of
		  German citizens who rather disap- proved refugee homes in
		  their vicinity. Their preferences have not changed between
		  November 2015, the peak of ``welcome culture,'' and
		  November 2016, after political debates, media reporting and
		  public discourse had shifted towards limiting admission of
		  immigrants. A minority of one fifth of the sample
		  population, who were initially rather approving of refugee
		  and migrant homes being established in their vicinity, were
		  more likely to change their pref- erences towards a rather
		  disapproving position in 2016. Experience of contact with
		  refugees and migrants, higher education, and general
		  pro-immigration attitudes explain acceptance of refugee and
		  migrant homes as well as preference stability over time.
		  Country of origin and religion of refugees and migrants are
		  considered less important than decent housing conditions
		  and whether refugee and migrants arrive as families or
		  single persons. In this respect our results highlight the
		  importance of humanitarian aspects of sheltering and inte-
		  gration of refugees and other migrants into society.},

  abstract	= {To provide practitioners with useful information about how
		  to promote proenvironmental behavior (PEB), a meta-analysis
		  was performed on 87 published reports containing 253
		  experimental treatments that measured an observed, not
		  self-reported, behavioral outcome. Most studies combined
		  multiple treatments, and this confounding precluded
		  definitive conclusions about which individual treatments
		  are most effective. Treatments that included cognitive
		  dissonance, goal setting, social modeling, and prompts
		  provided the overall largest effect sizes (Hedge's g >
		  0.60). Further analyses indicated that different treatments
		  have been more effective for certain behaviors. Although
		  average effect sizes are based on small numbers of studies,
		  effective combinations of treatments and behaviors are
		  making it easy to recycle, setting goals for conserving
		  gasoline, and modeling home energy conservation. The
		  results also reveal several gaps in the literature that
		  should guide further research, including both treatments
		  and PEB that have not been tested.},

  abstract	= {Electronic communication is emotionally gratifying, but
		  how do such technological distractions impact academic
		  learning? The current study observed 263 middle school,
		  high school and university students studying for 15min in
		  their homes. Observers noted technologies present and
		  computer windows open in the learning environment prior to
		  studying plus a minute-by-minute assessment of on-task
		  behavior, off-task technology use and open computer windows
		  during studying. A questionnaire assessed study strategies,
		  task-switching preference, technology attitudes, media
		  usage, monthly texting and phone calling, social networking
		  use and grade point average (GPA). Participants averaged
		  less than six minutes on task prior to switching most often
		  due to technological distractions including social media,
		  texting and preference for task-switching. Having a
		  positive attitude toward technology did not affect being
		  on-task during studying. However, those who preferred to
		  task-switch had more distracting technologies available and
		  were more likely to be off-task than others. Also, those
		  who accessed Facebook had lower GPAs than those who avoided
		  it. Finally, students with relatively high use of study
		  strategies were more likely to stay on-task than other
		  students. The educational implications include allowing
		  students short ``technology breaks'' to reduce distractions
		  and teaching students metacognitive strategies regarding
		  when interruptions negatively impact learning.},

  abstract	= {The Dutch government provides annual, detailed,
		  energy-efficiency feedback to individual companies that
		  have signed a voluntary agreement to increase their energy
		  efficiency. However, only about 14\% of all companies
		  actually download their dedicated report containing this
		  feedback. To increase the assumed positive effect of the
		  feedback, the Dutch government aims to increase this
		  download rate. Drawing upon insights from behavioral
		  economics, the present study investigates the effects of
		  alternative emails, inviting to download the feedback
		  report, on 505 companies' download behavior, in a
		  randomized controlled field experiment with two treatment
		  groups and one control group. The download rates for our
		  treatment groups are more than three times higher compared
		  to the control group. Survey results indicate that the
		  follow up behavior does not differ between the respondents
		  who were nudged and those who were not. Moreover, we found
		  indications that downloading the report induces the energy
		  coordinators to consider energy-saving measures. More
		  generally we have shown that policy targeting energy saving
		  of firms can benefit from using behavioral insights.
		  Relatively small changes in the implementation of specific
		  interventions can have large influences on the
		  effectiveness of the policy.},

		  choosing renewable energy sources or saving energy. While
		  there is an emerging literature on the instrumental
		  effectiveness of behavioral policy tools such as these,
		  their ethical assessment has largely been neglected. This
		  paper attempts to fill this gap by, first, providing a
		  structured overview of the most important contributions to
		  the literature on pro-environmental nudges and, second,
		  offering some critical considerations that may help the
		  practitioner come to an ethically informed assessment of

  abstract	= {This paper provides field evidence from India examining
		  changes in electricity consumption in response to various
		  behavioral interventions. I study the impact of (i) weekly
		  reports with peer comparisons of electricity use; (ii)
		  reports augmented with monetary incentives to reduce
		  consumption and (iii) price variation. I estimate
		  consumption changes using a randomized control trial in
		  conjunction with a quasi-experiment. Households provided
		  reports alone reduced summer season consumption by 7
		  percent. Price elasticity identified from cross-sectional
		  and time series variation was estimated at 0.56. Against
		  this benchmark, the impact of peer comparisons alone was
		  equivalent to increasing tariffs by about 12.5 percent.
		  Counter-intuitively, when weekly reports were augmented
		  with monetary incentives rewarding electricity
		  conservation, households no longer reduced consumption.
		  Households receiving reports also show higher price
		  elasticity relative to controls. These results provide new
		  evidence identifying the response of developing country
		  consumers to behavioral interventions while examining the
		  interaction of prices, incentives and information. (C) 2016

  abstract	= {Residential energy conservation is a key component of
		  contemporary energy, and climate change policy in the US
		  and elsewhere. Comparisons of the relative effectiveness of
		  measures aimed at reducing residential energy consumption
		  are made challenging, however, by the endogeneity of
		  technology and energy use decisions. In this paper we
		  describe a novel small-scale field experiment that uses
		  randomized treatments to estimate the returns to three
		  types of energy conservation measures in institutionally
		  owned homes. The results from the experiment indicate
		  considerable reductions in natural gas consumption
		  associated with the installation of attic insulation and
		  the provision of incentives for conservation. The results
		  are supported by observations of ambient indoor temperature
		  data, which show that households receiving incentives
		  significantly reduce their temperature settings especially
		  when coupled with access to a programmable thermostat. The
		  study will ideally provide guidance for institutions and
		  communities considering energy efficiency measures and for
		  future researchers designing randomized experiments to
		  study residential energy use. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

		  substantial at the organizational level. Rarely do
		  incentives for saving energy for the individual employee
		  and organization align, making conservation a challenge.
		  Here we perform a 12-week field experiment piloting two
		  behavioral strategies: (1) social norms feedback and (2)
		  awareness of energy monitoring, to encourage savings among
		  46 administrative staff at a university who were given the
		  impression of participating in an energy quality study to
		  reduce self-selection bias. Those in the social norms
		  feedback condition used significantly less energy during
		  the intervention (10\% less energy) and follow up
		  monitoring (11\% less energy) phases compared to their
		  baseline consumption. Moreover, these participants
		  demonstrated that they learned more about their energy use
		  than did those in the awareness monitoring condition. For
		  policy makers and building mangers interested in the
		  effectiveness of behavioral nudges in inducing energy
		  savings, social norms feedback appears to be an effective
		  energy savings nudge in an organizational setting where
		  there are neither financial savings at-stake nor intrinsic

  abstract	= {Energy efficiency is an important economic and
		  environmental concern, and likewise the correction of
		  current wasteful energy practices. We document widespread
		  ``tire pressure neglect{''} - three-quarters of drivers
		  waste gas driving on underinflated tires. Negative
		  descriptive social norms are one potential cause, but have
		  not been tested in high-neglect environments, where those
		  norms are widespread. This confounds the mechanism: are
		  these norms signals of private value to consumers, or do
		  they imply standards for social judgment from others? We
		  conducted a field experiment at gas stations in Chicago -
		  our intervention included treatments with information about
		  tire pressure neglect, promotions in the form of price
		  reductions from \$0.50 to free, a descriptive norm of
		  behavior, and ``help{''} in the form of air pump
		  assistance. The treatments are designed to provide the
		  ability to consider four potential underlying drivers:
		  information, monetary cost, social norms and social
		  pressure. Treatments that only included information were
		  ineffective, despite average fuel savings of \$10.51, but
		  small promotions had substantial impacts. When the air pump
		  price was free, the social norm discouraged inflation.
		  However, when the research assistant offered help,
		  inflation rates were buoyed by the social norm. These
		  results highlight the importance of incentives over mere
		  information treatments, and offer a new perspective on how
		  information and monetary levers can influence
		  decision-making in the presence of negative social norms.

  abstract	= {ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the
		  artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started
		  to be used in programming education. However, the effect of
		  using ChatGPT in programming education on learning
		  processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study
		  investigated the effect of programming education using the
		  ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills,
		  programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the
		  lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate
		  students who took a university-level programming course.
		  The research was carried out according to the experimental
		  design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students
		  were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and
		  control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group
		  students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly
		  programming practices, the control group students did not
		  use this tool. Research data were obtained through the
		  computational thinking scale, computer programming
		  self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer
		  programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that
		  the experimental group students' computational thinking
		  skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the
		  lesson were significantly higher than the control group
		  students. In line with this result, it can be said that it
		  may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as
		  ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it
		  was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in
		  the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were
		  made for researchers and educators in this regard.
